You will have 20 "Score"(tries),each time you pick a wrong number you "Score" will drop with 1.
If it go down to 0, you lose the game. Evry time you pick a number(unless it is the right one)
you will be getting a hint whether it is "Too high" or "Too low" from the right number. 
When you pick the right number, before you'r "Score" reaches 0, you win the game 
and if you'r remaining "Score" is higher than the current "Highscore" it is set as a new "Highscore".
